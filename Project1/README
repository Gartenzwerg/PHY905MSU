This project uses three numerical algebra algorithms to solve the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

File organization:
src contains the c++ code for the three algorithms. It also contains matlab code which generates charts of the results from the c++ code output files.

Benchmarks contains sample output files. 

Report contains the report.
